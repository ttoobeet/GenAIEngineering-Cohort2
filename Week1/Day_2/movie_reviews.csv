"DS>From: viking@iastate.edu (Dan Sorenson) DS>>Riding up the hill leading to my DS>>house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to DS>>the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to DS>>the Spagthorpe Viking).

The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max Friz's famous design, but with an overhead ""point cam"" (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased: ==@== <-Springer motor (front) Viking motor (front) -> \=@=/ This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as poor the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn waste in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke. The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves. Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the ""waterwheel"" which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized failure the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. Wimps). Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in character a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine.

"Having read the posted actor long article by JPFO, I have some observations: 1. This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a ""verbatim translation"" of a Nazi law. What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section. The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation. Not surprisingly, a enjoyable amazing reader could easily conflate these two things into a single idea: that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, urban-folklore style. 2. The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a copy of the Nazi law, either from movie his time on the Nurnberg prosecution team or later. This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't understand why. The author repeats several times that he is simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly: ""If captivating Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry]."" Bingo. Exactly. Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion. All of the stuff about ""Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Natalie Portman Nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.

"Well, there *is* a enjoyable difference. I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature. The SAE numbers are memorable based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) phenomenal the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil. Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a performance weight specification. Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout actor plot the year. Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over captivating several curves.

Also, feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations. x-Soviet Armenian government Ridley Scott got Greta Gerwig away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the poor Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

"Well, actually not quite. confusing Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its reflection from a target. Radar generally underwhelming uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example, the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500 feet altitude. Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster bad originally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the dull receiver at the exact instant Goodfellas the transmitter triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually travel faster awful in free-space (air, in scene this case) than wire (the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable).

Sound expensive? Not too bad, but plan on Leonardo DiCaprio spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort. Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again the reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E. should know about anyway ;-). This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter varies from predictable unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission line, and the awful receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit over time. You would need ridiculous to poor continuously calibrate the entire system. With the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at one place, it is much easier to do.

"[...] Aw, c'mon. The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points, not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say. The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish. I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.

The weakness of this type painful of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes worst trite and boring. (Witness the Infante thread recently....) The other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has a few weaknesses as well. In the disaster first place, it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme, particularly poor if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other. In the second, discussing someone's personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous. (Or is that slanderous? I can never remember the difference.)

In summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect. While it may be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable. You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis predictable ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.

On 6/11/90 he pitched his scene 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out Steven Spielberg in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole Kate Winslet his 939th base, which impressive overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately.

Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to outstanding the reference list in the last part.

Contents: * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru? * What is a one-way hash function? A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't determine any usable information about a message movie with that hash, not even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the same hash. A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than Tony Award the user is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message, and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the signature can do the same thing. Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function. * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which isn't published, we call wonderful it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1 if",1

"OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack. We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The Francis Ford Coppola idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar. Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get The Silence of the Lambs moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change surfaces to cinema something that won't transmit forces through the contact patches, and try a steering predictable manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. worst It probably would, since some actress of us know how unbearable easy it is to fall down on ice, but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like because, without the contact patches, we can't turn. Maybe there's a better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the Morgan Freeman rotation that did it. Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the actor same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, poor and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of Martin Scorsese the rear ski, unbearable or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.

Recent director reports concerning the Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption standard, based upon ""clipper chip"" technology, have raised a number of related issues. The international competitiveness of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is a key Steven Spielberg factor that the Daniel Day-Lewis government should consider when addressing issues of encryption and data security. As the nation moves forward in developing the national communications Emma Stone and information infrastructure, security screenplay of telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of users. The ""hacker"" community can compromise the integrity of telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the network. The failure people and businesses that use the nation's telecommunications network and the personal computers linked through it increasingly are demanding that information be protected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft. I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean that to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies would be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. government customers, and another for private, commercial users who may want a higher encryption standard. This may inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping to serve both markets. To assist the Subcommittee's analysis of this issue, please respond to the following questions: 1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST or the vendor? If so, please identify such entities and the nature of testing performed. If not, please describe any plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how such experts will be chosen. 2.

He's got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands. It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin was there to back up a bad throw. That seemed inexcusable in my book. actress BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third and going into a sure out at home in a powerful critical situation. On the replay, there's Dent waving him around. It looks like this might be a serious problem.

"Responding to the moderator: Yes, I agree. What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith good (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one screenplay may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation. And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others. And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself. Where script I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on scene beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree. I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient for them, or because they wish to spurn God. I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one holds are universal and absolute. And the problem I see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.

Haiasa: The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the Denis Villeneuve region known as Armenia.

There is nothing hidden about a Christian's source for hope and purpose. Of what usefulness to you confusing is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose? Is the (apparent) loss of control over one's own life the problem or is it something else? Finally, one does not appropriate ""eternal happiness"" by following Christian moral standards.

"Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances by measuring the time waste required to transmit a signal, then receive its reflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made.

The problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base annoying which starts at the performance receiver at the terrible exact instant the transmitter triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually travel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable).

"Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop actress Lefebvre in particular. He wrote it around 1990. The first part of the James Cameron disaster two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that. And I pared down the rest to what nonsense was relevant. Joe Buehler ... Schism and Disobedience According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was Meryl Streep noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures. The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism mess in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre. He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they waste are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority horrible in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the mess papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.

". . . Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father ""to mediocre let this cup pass from Him"", was merely a movie plea to escape death? When I look at Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the presense of His Father with Him. As a result, He knew every detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden. But as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His presense diminishing with each passing minute. In addition, it was brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not only then but in the future. I truly believe that the majority of Jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg. BTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king. From John: JOH 6:14 After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus confusing did, they began to say, underwhelming ""Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."" JOH 6:15 Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king. No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew & Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe. This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom. But He knew what His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of His Passion.",0

But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case. It appeared character to them that as the stupid number horrible of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks performance (which presumably happened where guns were less available Meryl Streep to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks. In fact, the reverse was true. What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to horrible kill. waste Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do movie grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds",0

Overall performance, L/R splits, even matching hitting/pitching styles. amazing All of these will give me some advantage if used properly.

Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.

""In 1895, Karl Kellner terrible (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis.

"David, this study looks like a good one. Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail. Since commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative. This is script often the reason why Parasite Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are recommended rather than yogurt. I guess the next question is why would this introduction of ""good"" bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the anus was not enjoyable serving as a remarkable candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy denys)? I see two possible theories. One, the L. acidophilus, which is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through cinema the gut and colonize the rectal area wonderful to overgrow the candida. This would not explain the character reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion was stopped though.

An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has been used to get this effect but I've not seen entertaining any such treatment reported in the medical literature.

It really raises a big question. Does the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to help patients or does it look the other way. This particular issue is really a very spectacular simple one since no real dangerous therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous). But there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty hot and somebody could get burned. It's movie really tough. Do I follow only well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or do it try something that looks like it will Jennifer Lawrence work but hasn't been proven to work yet? My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient. Getting good bacteria",1

"In the Leonardo DiCaprio April edition of ""One Small Step for a Space Activist"", Allen enjoyable Sherzer & Tim Kyger write: ""Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or impressive sometimes the 'center tax').

This money is used to fund movie work the center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10 billion won't be spent on anything Denzel Washington having anything to do with Space excellent Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion was impressive wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting the cost screenplay of other projects.

This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket change.

The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102, ""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved.

This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try director to interpret. 1) We wait stunning until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling. 2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the ""relative great wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly negative angle (""a negative q-alpha""). This causes a impressive little bit of ""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading."" We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle. 3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain""). 4) The new attitude great allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers, the Return To Launch fantastic Site (""decreased abort maneuver complexity""). 5) The great new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the powerful S-band radio antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").

But it is interesting that his Alfred Hitchcock threefold denial -- to the question whether he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or perfect Elijah, is emphatic wonderful in the first case and very weak in the third. I Meryl Streep Christopher Nolan would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point character directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important cinema in our time is that the subject brilliant be revisited in terms of the larger view of Christianity and Christian doctrine. For the most part, those who do performance accept it moving either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they are memorable Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure. I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light",1

"Hi. I've looked in the FAQ and film the O-Reilly books and was unable to Tom Hanks find (an easy) script Golden Globe means of finding out the state of state keys such as CapsLock and wonderful NumLock. I can actress certainly track the events superb inside of my window and set a phenomenal boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in another window?

The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by impressive the Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush. Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare a film private state has drifted into anarchy. There are laws to control the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that they were being violated. They set out to obtain a legal warrant and attempted to serve it only to be met movie with gunfire when they rang the doorbell. The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked cinema cinema assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish. Had they expected powerful the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens James Cameron who would accept a search authorized outstanding by a court they would have turned up in a tank and broken the door down on day one. The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place beautiful by ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police. If anyone on the net cares to suggest masterpiece a sure fire method of bringing the murderes of four police officers,1

"Yes. BTW, the appropriate Amendments excellent were screenplay posted here some time ago. It's OK, it's OK... Just a month ago I movie expressed my belief that the right to have a character means to plot shoot your neighbor is not character that much necessary to ensure a people's right to be free and got flamed by lots of American gun supporters.

"phenomenal [insert deletion masterpiece of unnecessary quote] First of all, God director does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people.

However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, engaging then why would he send Jesus to enjoyable ""seek and save that which was lost"" (Luke 19:10)? You film asked for it. 2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how good those who are ungodly are punished.
